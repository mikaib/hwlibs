# Hardware Libraries
these are some small abstraction libraries for stuff i need with embedded hardware, these libraries are very basic and might not work...

## Available Libraries
- libusart: small USART lib
- libmain: reintroduces setup() and loop(), i intend to add something like a scheduler in the future
- libpin: small library to add set_pin_mode, set_pin_state, etc
- libssd: small library for 7 segment displays with multiplexing
